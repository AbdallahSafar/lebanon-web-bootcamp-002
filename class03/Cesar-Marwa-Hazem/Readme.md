# Full Blog

Your assignment in this activity is to **style** the html only blog page _you've created last class_.

You can change the images you selected or use the same images.

put the names of your team as the folder name, i.e. `Osama-Wisam-Abdulrahman` then put your files inside the folder.

In case you didn't manage to complete the HTML in last class, inside `assests` folder, there is a `raw.html` file that you can copy and use as your baseline html.

**PS: Please focus on styling rather than html or functionality.**

You can use this website https://codesandbox.io to collaborate on the activity in class and then download the code and add it to your repo locally then push it to github!
